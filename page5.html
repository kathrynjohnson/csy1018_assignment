    <p>The main websites that I looked at these websites: Thisiscolossal, Mikiya Kobayashi and Rock Group. To begin with I tried to make the website from scratch but about halfway through planning it I realised that I needed to take inspiration from other sources. I spent a couple hours searching the web looking at different websites that caught my attention. The three website that I finally settled one where This is Colossal, Mikiya and Rock Group. 
    
    The reason that I picked Colossal was because of it’s simple layout and design. The design was simple yet effective. It had the main content going down the left of the page and a sidebar on the right. I liked how the content went from one post to another. I also liked how the navigation bar changed colour when you hovered your mouse over it. I used this in my website as I thought it would make the pages look better.
    
    I took inspiration from Mikiya’s page because the images where clear and well put together. I wanted to try and recreate the same style that Mikiya used on their website. I also liked how simple the pages were. 
    
    I also took inspiration from the Rock Group page of it’s use of pastel colours. I liked how they made their page’s roll into one as you scroll down. 
    I decided that I would take the simplest style that I had seen throughout each website and implement it in my own.
