    <section5>
      <p>The differences between these two jobs are that the second job lists more of what is expected from the individuals who will be applying for this job. Where as the first job, Junior Ruby RoR Developer, only give a brief explanation of what they are looking for. The second job, Junior PHP Developer, feels a lot more professional due to their description of the job being more detailed. The Junior Ruby RoR Developer job does not give a good description of what they will be doing on the job whereas the Junior php Developer job states perfectively that they are looking for someone who is able to locate and fix bugs in code. Personally, I would go for the Junior PHP Developer as it is clearer what the person is looking for and what type of job they need. It would be better if Job 1 had a better description of what the job details would be.</p>
